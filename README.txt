Hotfix Hud v10 by E-Mxp.
For Tremulous GrangerHub.

This project tries to create a framework in which huds can be created that will work for both GPP and 1.1.
This builds on top of the Hotfix hud versions for Tremulous GPP and Unvanquished.

MAIN FEATURES:
* 3 hud layouts! Default, Centered, Compact!
* Custom loadingscreen.
* For all the layouts you have a choice of 4 color schemes:
    - Vanilla (Default colors)
	- The Superpie hud color scheme.
	- The Warrior hud color scheme. Based off the Warrior's Hud by Warrior.
	- The Hellrider hud color scheme. Based off the Hellrider Hud (v1.1) by Hellrider.
* The option to place the Adv. Good barbs underneath the crosshair.
* Optional fullscreen radar.
* Optional Human crosshair dot in 4 colors: white, blue, red and black.

FRAMEWORK:
* Mostly able to seperate the UI layouts and the colorschemes so changes to the layout will apply for all colorschemes and vice-versa.

TODO:
* Integrate options into the main menu.
* Port the other layouts from GPP to 1.1, now only the default layout has been ported.
* Find a way to make it easier to select which files to load, it still requires 4 files for each colorscheme and layout which will quickly become hard to maintain.
* Implement / support changes from the 1.3 test build.

V10.0: GrangerHub
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Alpha release

Special thanks to:
Superpie, for creating the Tweaked GPP HUD I know and love.
Warrior, for crafting the Warrior's Hud, a hud thats very colorfull and nice.
Hellrider, for spawning the Hellrider Hud, a hud that looks quite cool and not black and white yet.
Meisseli, for making up a very easy way to fix the inventory aspect ratio problem. Try his HUD out!
Mox, for giving me the idea to add pictures to the main menu. His AdjustableHUD is really good, try it!
Oticz, for his dot crosshair code. If you still play 1.1, his HUD is highly recommended!
GeneralScott, for giving me full permission to use his staminabar code, awesome!
Kang's hud, who had the most awesome loadingscreen I have seen in Tremulous!

A great help was this site on Icculus.org (http://icculus.org/~phaethon/q3tamenu/q3tamenu.html) and is recommanded to everyone trying to make huds for Tremulous!
